Musicon - Music Instruments Online Store


Project Objectives

BUILDING INTERACTIVE JAVASCRIPT WEBSITES
Musicon
In this project, we will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. We will incorporate our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. Our job is to set up home and store pages with HTML and CSS, then we will make the following changes:

- Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
- Style the website using our knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
- Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
- Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.

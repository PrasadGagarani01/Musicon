Musicon - Music Instruments Online Store


Project Objective

BUILDING INTERACTIVE JAVASCRIPT WEBSITE
Musicon
In this project, I have built the website for an online musical instruments store, Musicon. I incorporated my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon has three seperate web pages: A home pagem store page and the content page.The website is designed using basics of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

- Created a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
- Styled the website using our knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
- Built semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
- Displayed the relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
